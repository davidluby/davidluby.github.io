# davidluby.github.io
Flask Frozen archive of first website (Python/HTML/CSS). This site was deployed on AWS EB using a CI/CD CodePipeline linked to my website repo. No javascript was involved here, and my writing of that represents my expectations for its usage before converting to a Flask-React-MSSQL stack.


From the website repository:

# website

This repository represents my website portfolio as of 2/9/2023. It uses only HTML and CSS, despite what the homepage says. react.js development, database integration, real API usage, and final content changes will be handled in another repository.
